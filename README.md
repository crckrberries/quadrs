# quadrs

This is a simple rust program that solves quadratic equations. I made this in around 2 hours, and as with all of my projects it will collapse spacetime if you push it too hard.

## Usage
quadrs <equation>

Surround the equation in quotes, and use infix notation. Examples:
`"-8x^2 - 12x - 47"`
`"3x^2 - 15x - 4"`

i really didnt have the energy to write this properly, kindly dont break my legs
